"Working With Files and the File API in Drupal 7" Video Series Resource Pack
===================================================

This is the collection of files that are used in the "[Working With Files and the File API in Drupal 7](http://buildamodule.com/collection/working-with-files-and-the-file-api)" video collection on [BuildAModule](http://buildamodule.com). This is a specialized and short collection where we discuss:

* How to work with managed and unmanaged files
* How to work with private files
* How stream wrappers work in Drupal 7

Many of the files here use a custom '.step' extension, which are referred to as 'step files'. This convention allows you to open all of the files in the editor of your choice, allows us to make hidden files visible, and makes it clear that the name of the step file is not the name of the final file that you will be using.

Enjoy!
